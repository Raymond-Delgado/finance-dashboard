# finance-dashboard

A full‑stack personal finance dashboard that tracks income, expenses, and net worth over time.

This project showcases my ability to build a full‑stack web application using modern development tools and best practices. The finance dashboard demonstrates skills in React, Node.js, Express, SQL/SQLite, REST API design, data modeling, and interactive data visualization. It highlights my capability to architect clean backend services, build responsive frontend interfaces, and integrate real‑world financial logic into a production‑style application—skills directly aligned with full‑stack software development roles.
